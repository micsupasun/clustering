# Customer segmentation project
## Objective
The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation using machine learning techniques. Customer segmentation aims to divide a customer base into distinct groups with similar characteristics to allow for more targeted marketing strategies. The project uses a dataset of customer information to identify these segments.

## Step
